From the quantitative metric of ID similarity, the improvement is about 5 percentage points. Meanwhile, the editability remains similar as before. |


## :wrench: Dependencies and Installation
- Python >= 3.9 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- [PyTorch >= 2.0](https://pytorch.org/) if you don't need flux-dev-fp8, otherwise [PyTorch >= 2.4.1](https://pytorch.org/)
```bash
# clone PuLID repo
git clone https://github.com/ToTheBeginning/PuLID.git
cd PuLID
# create conda env
conda create --name pulid python=3.10
# activate env
conda activate pulid
# Install dependent packages
# 1. if you don't need flux-fp8, e.g., you are using xl or flux-bf16, install the following requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. if you need flux-fp8 (to put flux on consumer-grade gpu), install the following requirements_fp8.txt
pip install -r requirements_fp8.txt
```

## :zap: Quick Inference
